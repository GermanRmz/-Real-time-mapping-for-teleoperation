 This study presents the development of virtual
environments as control centers for remote teleoperation tasks
of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Initially, our focus lies
on reconstructing outdoor environments using a ZED mini
stereo camera and reconstructing them through point cloud
techniques. The virtual environment is hosted in UNITY, a
widely recognized platform for designing virtual reality (VR)
video games. Within this environment, a digital twin UAV
is embedded, tasked with replicating the real positions and
orientations of the vehicle. To achieve this, we propose the use
of PID and PD control for the positions and rotations of the
virtual vehicle, allowing it to follow the desired position, in this
case, the real position of the vehicle. A series of experiments
were conducted in an outdoor environment to validate the
functionality of this approach.
